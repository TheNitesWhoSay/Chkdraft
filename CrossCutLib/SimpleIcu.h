        The general philosophy by projects using this extension
        should be to only use UTF-8

        For situations where the libraries demand a different encoding
        use of that encoding should be minimized

        If a strings in other encodings have a clearly identifiable purpose
        such as filesystem operations or ui displays, then that string
        should have an explicit type defined so the string type/encoding
        can easily be swapped out depending on #defined variables;
        converters should be setup to and from UTF-8, and rules regarding
        how far a type should persist should be clearly defined
